# How to do a form with useContext?

Can't figure out how to create a form with it's children using Context for sharing state. Every dispatch from a child re-renders child so no input is possible. I have given up for now. I'm putting it all in one component and use reducer for state management.

UPDATE: It looks like it's not because of context, at least not form context.
